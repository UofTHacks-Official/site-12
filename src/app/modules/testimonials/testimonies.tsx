        message: "UofT Hacks was a fantastic learning experience for my whole team. For me, this was my first ever hackathon, and the first time attempting to complete an entire project in only a weekend. Of course we had many challenged to overcome while creating our project, but overall we are proud of what we created and demoed in front of the judges. The #1 tip I have for new hackers: start working on the presentation early!",

        message: "I’ve participated in dozens of hackathons, but UofT Hacks 11 was the most fun. Out of the 36-hour coding marathon, my team spent 16 hours deciding what to build. A walk to Shoppers Drug Mart finally inspired us to create a Furby.  With no clue where to start, we quickly learned new technologies and APIs. Thanks to mentors and YouTube tutorials, we brought our quirky idea to life.  The food? Incredible—I was stuffed all weekend!  UofTHacks brings together ambitious people and teaches lessons you can’t learn in a classroom. My biggest takeaway? You don’t need a perfect plan—just a solid idea to build on.",
